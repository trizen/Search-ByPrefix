# Search::ByPrefix

[Search::ByPrefix](https://metacpan.org/release/Search-ByPrefix) works by creating an internal table from a list of key/value pairs, where each key is an array.

Then, this table can be efficiently searched with an array prefix-key, which finds and returns all the values that have this certain prefix.

```perl
    use Search::ByPrefix;
    my $sbp = Search::ByPrefix->new;

    # Add an entry
    $sbp->add($key, $value);                 # where $key is an array

    # Search by a prefix
    my @matches = $sbp->search($prefix);     # where $prefix is an array
```

This example illustrates how to add some key/value pairs to the table and how to search the table with a given prefix:

```perl
    use 5.010;
    use Search::ByPrefix;
    my $obj = Search::ByPrefix->new;

    sub make_key {
        [split('/', $_[0])]
    }

    foreach my $dir (
                     qw(
                     /home/user1/tmp/coverage/test
                     /home/user1/tmp/covert/operator
                     /home/user1/tmp/coven/members
                     /home/user2/tmp/coven/members
                     /home/user1/tmp2/coven/members
                     )
      ) {
        $obj->add(make_key($dir), $dir);
    }

    # Finds the directories that have this common path
    say for $obj->search(make_key('/home/user1/tmp'));
```

The results are:

```perl
    "/home/user1/tmp/coverage/test"
    "/home/user1/tmp/covert/operator"
    "/home/user1/tmp/coven/members"
```
